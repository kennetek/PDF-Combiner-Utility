# Quick PDF Combining Utility
Simple project done as a test of my "improvements" on the Java swing JComponents. Also because I was tired of using the command line to merge PDF files, it just was not fast enough for me.

## Install
If you actually want to try it out, download the latest release, unzip the file, and run using 

`java -jar PDFCombiner-<version>.jar`

Requires Java 12 or newer.
